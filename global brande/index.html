                <p>Wenger has consistently used the Emirates Cup as an opportunity to hand first-team experience to Arsenal's most promising youngsters. That doesn't mean an appearance in the summer tournament is a guarantee of future success - Yaya Sanogo scored four in one game in the 2014 edition - but the home supporters in attendance this weekend will feel excited about the latest crop emerging from the youth ranks.

                </p>
                <p>Reiss Nelson was undoubtedly the standout prospect on show across the two days. The 17-year-old England youth international dribbled at his Benfica markers with pace and confidence, recorded an assist with a neat left-foot cross and backed up a fine pre-season with the senior side</p>
                <p>But 19-year-old Maitland-Niles also earned credit in an unfamiliar centre-back role on Saturday, using his pace and skill on the ball to get himself out of tricky situations, while Joe Willock, 17, was tidy in the centre of the park against Sevilla, and 21-year-old Cohen Bramall - who was playing for non-league Hednesford Town this time last summer - produced a goal-saving interception during his 45 minutes on Sunday. The future's bright.</p>
